# Apache Arrow Data Experiments

This directory contains various datasets that are used by the experiments
in this repository or intended to be used in future Arrow experiments.
This currently includes data used to generate compelling examples that is
more realistic than generated data or the testing data found in
[apache/arrow-testing](http://github.com/apache/arrow-testing). This
directory is intended as a semi-temporary staging area; eventually, much
of the data here should find a permanent home elsewhere.
