# Apache Arrow Data Experiments

This subdirectory contains experimental Arrow data whose purpose has not
yet become clear but may be useful in the future. This currently includes
data used to generate compelling examples that is more realistic than
generated data or the testing data found in
[apache/arrow-testing](http://github.com/apache/arrow-testing). This
subdirectory is intended as a semi-temporary staging area: eventually,
data here should find a permanent home elsewhere or be removed.
