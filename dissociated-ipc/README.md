# Arrow Dissociated IPC Protocol Example

This directory contains a reference example implementation of the
[Arrow Dissociated IPC Protocol](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/DissociatedIPC.html).

This protocol splits the Arrow Flatbuffers IPC metadata and the body buffers
into separate streams to allow for utilizing shared memory, non-cpu device
memory, or remote memory (RDMA) with Arrow formatted datasets.

This example utilizes [libcudf](https://docs.rapids.ai/api) and
[UCX](https://openucx.readthedocs.io/en/master/#) to transfer Arrow data
located on an NVIDIA GPU.

## Building

You must have libcudf, libarrow, libarrow_flight, libarrow_cuda, and ucx
accessible on your `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`/`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` so that `cmake` can find them.

After that you can simply do the following:

```console
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build
```

to build the `arrow-cudf-flight` mainprog.

## Running

You can start the server by just running `arrow-cudf-flight` which will
default to using `31337` as the Flight port and `127.0.0.1` for the host.
Both of these can be changed via the `-port` and `-address` gflags
respectively.

You can run the client by adding the `-client` option when running the
command.
